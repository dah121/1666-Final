Changes:

-tower team selection now supported- press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to change to the corresponding team when placing next tower.
				     HOLD 1, 2, 3, or 4 and click on a tower to change its team.
				**** I think we ned a UI element that shows what team is currently selected.
-Enemy Prefab- Folder enemy fully implemented (I think). Health bars, etc. (not sure if they give cash on death)
-Towers don't get placed on top of one another anymore

*In the process of combining things.
