Changes:

-tower team selection now supported- press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to change to the corresponding team when placing next tower.
				     HOLD 1, 2, 3, or 4 and click on a tower to change its team.
				**** I think we ned a UI element that shows what team is currently selected.
-Enemy Prefab(?)- I made a file folder enemy (I think it's called "folder" and its in a scene about RNG enemy names
		-RNG Task names are implemented (i.e. can be generated) but are not on the enemies (problems with 3D text, I'll work on it)
-Towers don't get placed on top of one another anymore

*I'll try and combine everything that's currently up. maybe make a better level.
also going to implement upgrading soon
